 -⚡ Fun fact: Spent some time in prison for filing a complaint about the police in canada. AMA Trapped there currently waiting for charges they filed against me to be thrown out. OR years in prison they've already detained me a year and now on an ankle bracelet. Have gotten threatened multiple times over the last few years by local pd as they attempt to force a guilty plea. They also assaulted me one day breaking several ribs while yelling racist slurs, on camera and charged me with assaulting them because I raised my hands to cover my face during the assault. Unprovoked. Civil rights are a complete myth in the area. Don't vacation or travel unless you are very known white xristian, super racist with the most poverty and drug use I've seen worldwide so far. openly corrupt nation.
